			<h1>Hello, I'm Claire</h1>

			<p>
				First year student at IESEG School of Management with the accreditations EQUIS, AACSB and AMBA, I want to develop strong skills in management, strategy and leadership. Having always had a penchant for the business world, I am particularly interested in team management and project management issues. I am constantly looking for new opportunities to apply my knowledge and expand my network. I am determined to work in a dynamic and innovative environment. Alongside my studies, I like to play tennis, share moments with my family and friends. Furthermore I likee to travel.

			<h2>~ Volunteer ~</h2>	
			<p>
				I was volunteer in Belfast, Northern Ireland as : assistant at Save the Children UK and Action Cancer Ormeau Road Furniture as well as volunteer at the pub, The Errigle Inn. This has brought me experience and commitment.

			<div class="card" id="tennis">
			<h3>~ Tennis ~</h3>
			<p>
				I like play tennis. This sport has taught me discipline, how to manage stress and pressure, how to give my best. Tennis has brought me social skills and sportmanship.

			<div class="card" id="family">
			<h3>~ Family and friends ~</h3>
			<p>
				I enjoy sharing moments with my entourage, which help me build bonds and create unforgettable memories. Also these moments create mutual support when it is necessary.

			<div class="card" id="travel">
			<h3>~ Travels ~</h3>
			<p>
				I like to travel a lot. It allows me to discover new cultures, to take a break from the routine, to recharge my batteries and to take a step back. Every trip is an opportunity to learn, whether it’s through the history of a place, the local language or the arts.
				Also, travels creates many memories. Travelling widens horizons, encouraging a more tolerant and understanding view of the world. Whether with family or friends, sharing travel moments can strengthen relationships.
